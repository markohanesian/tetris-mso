# Tetris-Mso (updated name tbd)
My version of Tetris based off Ania Kubow's tetris tutorial for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=rAUn1Lom6dw&feature=emb_logo)

Play the game [here](https://markohanesian.github.io/tetris-mso/)

## How to Play
Currently, the game is functional using your keyboard only

To play, click the "PLAY" button, then use your keyboard's arrows to move the tetromino (shapes) left and right. To rotate the tetromino, press arrow up.
