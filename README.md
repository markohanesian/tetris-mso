# Tetris-Mso
My version of Tetris based off Ania Kubow's tetris tutorial for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=rAUn1Lom6dw&feature=emb_logo)

Play the game [here](https://markohanesian.github.io/tetris-mso/)

## How to Play
Currently, the game is functional using your keyboard only

To play, click the "PLAY" button, then use your keyboard's arrows to move the tetromino (shapes) left and right. To rotate the tetromino, press arrow up.

## About
Tetris MSO is a web browser game based off the original Tetris game, built with javascript for functionality and styled with CSS. 

This game is a project that I started to practice using javascript fundamentals, and see how complex of a game I can make with them. This would probably be a lot easier with a game engine, but I want to see how far this can go.
